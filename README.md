<h1> Introduction </h1>
AutoDrawer is a program that allows users to draw imported images using their cursor. It is an open source project that has both a C++ (v2) and C# (v1, discontinued) version. The program supports Windows (v1 onwards) and Linux (v2 onwards). The program controls the movement of the cursor, allowing for precise tracing of an imported image. AutoDrawer is often used as a utility in drawing games, providing an easy and intuitive way for players to draw images.

<h3> Version 1</h3>

AutoDrawer was originally created as a fork of [rainzhao2000](https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer)'s software and has since been modified to support automatic drawing in more drawing games. This version is coded in C# and uses the WPF user interface framework. AutoDrawer is open source and only supports the Windows operating systems.

<h3> Version 2 </h3>
AutoDraw Version 2 is a significant update to the original AutoDraw program. It has been completely rewritten in the C++ programming language, which allows it to run on both Windows and Linux systems. This new version consists of a C++ application that uses the QT framework for design. 

Currently, AutoDraw Version 2 is still in development and is not yet ready for release.
